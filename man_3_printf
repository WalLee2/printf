.SH NAME
_printf
.SH SYNOPSIS
Simplified version of printf
.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf is a function that produces output according to format. It takes into account several specifiers: "c", "s", "%", "d" and "i". However, _printf does not reproduce the buffer handling of the C library  printf function.
.SH OPTIONS
No options. It does not handle the flag characters, the field width, precision or the length modifiers.
.SH BUGS
(Tests run under Vagrant, Ubuntu 14.04) Hopefully, none. Actually, does not handle several "%" signs or if "%" does not follow an identifier, such as "c", "s", "d", or "i" for example, "%" will not print when it is supposed to such as in "%z;1234\n" which prints ";1234\n", while the correct output should be "%;1234".
.B Also, see Betty for more details about the tests and the format chosen:
